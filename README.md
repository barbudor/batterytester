Introduction
============

Batteries-tester for up to 3 batteries (typically Li-* batteries). The circuite uses a INA3221 triple current
sensor to measure batteries voltage and current drawn during a discharge cycle. Measrumentss are logged into
the file system as CSV files which can then be imported in Excel in order to draw graph or perform additional
calculations.

Dependencies
=============
This script depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/AdafruitCircuitPythonBusDevice>`_
* Barbudor's `CircuitPython_INA3221 driver <https://github.com/barbudor/CircuitPython_INA3221>`_

Contributing
============

This is a simple test I've done for my own usage for which is not worth contribution.
